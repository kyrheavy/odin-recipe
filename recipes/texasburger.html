    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat a grill for high heat. When the grill is hot, lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, hickory seasoning, salt and pepper until well blended. Make 20 balls, and flatten into patties. On one half of the patties, distribute the onions, mushrooms, ham and cheese.
